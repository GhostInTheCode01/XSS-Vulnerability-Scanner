# XSS-Vulnerability-Scanner
**Description**

The XSS Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It works by injecting common XSS payloads into the query parameters of URLs and analyzing the responses for reflections of the payloads. The tool supports both GET and POST methods and can scan multiple URLs in parallel using threading.

**Features**

Tests multiple URLs or a single URL for XSS vulnerabilities.
Supports common XSS payloads.
Can use both GET and POST HTTP methods.
Allows custom headers and cookies to simulate real-world scenarios.
Logs results to a file for later review.
Runs tests in parallel using multiple threads for faster scanning.
Payloads Tested
Basic <script> injection
Event handler injection (onerror, onload)
Image and SVG-based injections
SQL-like injections combined with XSS
JavaScript-based injection via iframe and others
